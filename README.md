## üìÑ About the Project

This is a Java console project that simulates the basic operations of a bank account. It was developed as a practical exercise to apply programming logic and business rule concepts in an interactive environment.

The system is controlled by a terminal-based menu, allowing the user to choose the desired actions in a simple and direct way.

## ‚ú® Features

The system offers an interactive menu with the following operations:

-   üí∞ **Check Available Balance:** Displays the current account balance.
-   üí≥ **Check Overdraft Limit:** Shows the total limit and the amount already used.
-   üì• **Make Deposits:** Adds funds to the account balance.
-   üí∏ **Perform Withdrawals:** Withdraws funds from the account, using the overdraft limit if necessary.
-   üìÑ **Pay Bills:** Works similarly to a withdrawal to debit the amount.
-   üö® **Check Overdraft Usage:** Informs if the account is currently using the overdraft limit.
-   üö™ **Exit:** Terminates the program's execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Business Rules

The bank account logic follows a specific set of rules, mainly related to the overdraft feature:

#### **Overdraft Limit**

-   The limit is defined at the time of **account creation**, based on the initial deposit amount:
    -   If the initial deposit is **‚â§ $500.00**, the overdraft limit will be **$50.00**.
    -   If the initial deposit is **> $500.00**, the overdraft limit will be **50% of the deposited amount**.

#### **Usage Fee**

-   When any amount of the overdraft is used, a **fee of 20%** on the *used* amount will be charged.
-   This fee is automatically charged as soon as the account receives a deposit that covers the amount due (the used overdraft balance + the fee).

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

To run this project, you will need to have the **JDK (Java Development Kit)** installed on your machine.
