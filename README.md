## üìÑ About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive compilation of my Java practice exercises. It includes projects and challenges completed during university coursework, various bootcamps, and online courses. The goal is to document my learning journey, showcase applied programming logic, and reinforce fundamental to advanced Java concepts.

Each exercise is designed to be a standalone, console-based application, focusing on specific problem-solving techniques and business rules.

## üìö Exercise Categories and Projects

This section outlines the different categories of exercises and lists the projects contained within each. For detailed information on features, business rules, and execution instructions for any project, please refer to its dedicated `README.md` file within its respective folder.

### Core Java Concepts

Exercises focusing on fundamental Java programming, data types, control flow, methods, and basic object-oriented principles.

* #### **Arrays and Data Structures**
    * **[Array Notes Challenge (DesafioArrayNotas)](https://github.com/FlavioEduardo92/ExerciciosJava/tree/main/src/Exercicios/arrays)**: A console application to calculate the average of student grades using arrays, loops, and basic input/output.
    * * * #### **Conditional Logic and Loops**
    * * #### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**
    * ### Intermediate Java Projects

Projects that delve into more complex data structures, algorithms, file I/O, error handling, and advanced OOP concepts.

* #### **Bank Account Simulation**
    * **[Java Bank Account Project (ContaBancaria)](https://github.com/FlavioEduardo92/ExerciciosJava/tree/main/src/Exercicios/conta)**: A console application simulating bank account operations, focusing on **OOP (classes, objects, encapsulation, methods)**, **conditional logic**, **loops**, **input validation**, and **exception handling**. It implements specific **business rules** for overdraft limits and fees.
    * * #### **Data Processing and Manipulation**
    * ### Advanced Topics and Frameworks

Exercises exploring advanced Java features, concurrent programming, basic API integrations, or frameworks.

* #### **Collections and Streams**
    * * #### **File I/O and Serialization**
    * * #### **Exception Handling**
    * ## üöÄ How to Run Exercises

To run any of the exercises in this repository, you will need to have the **JDK (Java Development Kit)** installed on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/FlavioEduardo92/ExerciciosJava.git](https://github.com/FlavioEduardo92/ExerciciosJava.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the repository folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ExerciciosJava
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the source folder:**
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
4.  **Compile and Run a specific exercise:**
    * Each exercise is typically located in its own subfolder (e.g., `Exercicios/arrays/DesafioArrayNotas/` or `Exercicios/ContaBancaria/`).
    * To compile and run a specific exercise, you'll generally need to navigate to its root folder (or specify the full path to its `.java` file) and then run the main class.

    **Example for `DesafioArrayNotas`:**
    ```bash
    # From the 'src' directory:
    cd Exercicios/arrays/DesafioArrayNotas
    javac DesafioArrayNotas.java
    java DesafioArrayNotas
    ```
    * **Note:** Some projects might require compiling multiple `.java` files together. Refer to the specific `README.md` inside each exercise's folder for detailed instructions if needed.
